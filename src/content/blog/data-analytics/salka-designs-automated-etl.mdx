### Project Summary

Sälka Designs is a small business looking to streamline their production process by automating their production schedule and bill of materials (often referred to as a BOM). The goal was to create an automated, cloud-based pipeline that would ingest their order data from their Squarespace e-commerce and create a report to help the production team with managing weekly orders. In addition, we needed to store the cleaned data in a database for future sales reports and other extensions from this project based on business needs.

### Project Requirements

Sälka Designs needs a weekly excel file with three separate reports:

- Pending Orders
- Order Schedule
- Bill of Materials (materials cut list)
