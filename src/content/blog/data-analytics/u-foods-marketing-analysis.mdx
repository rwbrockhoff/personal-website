### Data Analysis Summary

- Married, educated users with 0-1 children are the most likely to accept campaigns and spend more.
- Campaigns are effective in increasing wine sales, and more recent campaigns (3-5) have been more effective.
- Age groups of 23-30 and 70+ are smaller in population size, but show promising results with higher campaign conversions, higher spent on campaigns, and high web traffic conversion.
- Catalog customers are more likely to accept campaigns than in-store or web purchases (by 8%).

<br />
### Top Performing Customer Segments

Customers that are married, educated, with 0-1 children, between ages of 41 and 50 were the most likely to accept campaigns and have higher sales overall. This group significantly outperforms similar segments.

### Individual Campaigns

Campaigns 3-5 were most effective at converting customers while Campaign 2 was significantly less effective. Campaigns showed a strong relationship with total spent on wine products (even more than total spent overall).

<br />
**Steps to Consider:**

- Continue using more recent campaign strategies, as these have been more effective.
- Emphasize wine sales in marketing campaigns.

### Age Groups and Campaign Conversion

41-50 age group is accepting the most campaigns overall, but have a lower conversion rate. Whereas 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 age groups have a much better conversion rate while still having similar results. Meanwhile, our 23-30 and 71-81 age groups have a higher conversion rate for campaigns, but far fewer customers fall in these age brackets.

<br />
**Steps to Consider:**

- Work on increasing conversion for ages 41-50 where they have the highest accepted campaigns but at a significantly lower conversion rate.
- Focus on bringing in more users between ages 23-30 and 70+. While these demographics are a smaller portion of your total user base, they have a significantly higher campaign conversion.

### Campaign Methods (In Store, Web, Catalog)

While in person and web sales account for a majority of sales, catalog customers were more likely to accept campaigns (8% increase).

<br />
**Steps to Consider:**

- Consider increasing investment in catalog campaigns to see if it generates more sales without impacting online or web purchases.
- Or consider stronger marketing effort for in store purchases since it accounts for the biggest percentage of overall sales.

### Amount Spent vs Number of Children

The fewer children a customer has, the more likely they are to accept campaigns and spend more.

<br />
**Steps to Consider:**

- Focus marketing efforts on those with fewer children.
- Explore product and marketing offering for families.

### Average Spent Based on Education

Those with a basic education level have a low average order value and accept significantly fewer campaigns. Where as all other education levels have a comparable order value and campaign acceptance.

<br />
**Steps to Consider:**

- Focus marketing efforts on those with at least a graduation education level.
- Explore why basic education level individuals are less receptive to campaigns and overall spending.

### Campaign Acceptance Based on Marital Status

<br />
**Steps to Consider:**

### Web Traffic Conversion

Web conversion rates are generally high for all demographics. However, ages 31-50 account for the most website visits and have a lower conversion rate compared to other age groups. Similar conversion findings were found for accepting campaigns as well.

<br />
**Steps to Consider:**

- Focus on increasing web conversion for 41-50 age group since it has the highest web traffic and a lower purchase conversion.
- Try to expand user base for demographics that show high web traffic conversion.
